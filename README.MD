# NodeJS File System

## **   The task is about to create an API endpoint. Using the post method, we can create a folder, a file and the content of the file **

1. The file name will be the current date-time.txt and the content of the file will contain the current timestamp.
 
2. The following steps will help you do this:
 
   1. Add this route (create_folder_file) to create a folder with a file and content.

2. Use this JSON format to provide the folder name.

          {

         "folderName": "Nodejs"

          }

3. In the task, I have given a folder name as Nodejs and the file name will be the current date-time.txt and the content will be the current timestamp.

4. Next task is about to retrive the file from the folder. we can acheive this by using get method.

    1. Use this http://localhost:3000/folder/:folderName server to retrieve the file from the folder. For instance, my folder name is Nodejs, so I will give the route as /folder/Nodejs.

5. Run the server bu using npm run dev.
